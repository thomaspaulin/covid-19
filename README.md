# COVID-19 Incidence
A simple hobby project to get some hands-on experience with Javascript mapping libraries.

## Running
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Run
In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

Runs a development server. View the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Tests
In the project directory, you can run:
`npm test`

The automated test suite has not yet been completed, however, as I was learning everything as I went and did not decide to take a test driven approach.

### Building for Production
`npm run build`
