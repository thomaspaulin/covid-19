# COVID-19 Distribution Map

This project is intended to give me some experience developing in React, whilst making something which also has use beyond the standard beginner applications such as a to-do app. I also wanted to investigate geospatial libraries and data in Javascript seeing as many other ideas I have revolve around geospatial data.

This project's build log can be viewed on my [blog](https://blog.thomaspaulin.me/2020/03/covid-19-distribution/).

## Running, Testing, and Building

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Run

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

Runs a development server. View the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Tests

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm test`

The automated test suite has not yet been completed, however, as I was learning everything as I went and did not decide to take a test driven approach.

### Building for Production

`npm run build`
